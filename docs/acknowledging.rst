Acknowledging and citing ``agnpy``
==================================

As a general acknowledgement of `agnpy` usage, we recommend citing the agnpy release paper.
Additionaly, to specify which exact version of `agnpy` is being used, that verison's zenodo record can be cited.
We recommend citing both.

At the following links you can find:

 * `the agnpy release paper (for a general citation) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...660A..18N/abstract>`_;
 * `the zenodo record (for citing a specific version) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4055175>`_

The citation might read:

.. code-block:: latex

   To compute the SED we made use of \texttt{agnpy}, a \texttt{python} package modelling the radiative processes of jetted AGN \cite{agnpy_paper};
   version XX.YY.ZZ \cite{agnpy_zenodo} of the package was employed.

You can obtain ``bitbex`` entries for the release paper and the zenodo record from the links provided above.

Note on formulae
----------------
The release paper contains an appendix detailing all the formulae used for the package implementation.
